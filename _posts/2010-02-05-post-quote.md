I woke up still sore from swimming yesterday evening. Got fresh, checked football results for yesterday’s games, and decided to explore bicycle insurance plans since I need to get one for my cycle soon. After making a Chocolate-Banana milkshake and a boiled egg, I sat down to have my breakfast while watching YouTube. A video about bicycle maintenance popped up on my feed, and I clicked on it. While watching it, I felt a sudden urge to hit the streets on my bike.

Recently, I bought the Giant Escape R3 SE. The bike is extremely sleek, looks classy, and is very easy to ride in the city. Back in January, I had rented a bike to explore the city. It was the first time I ever went biking in the city. I had planned to follow a route I found online that covered the best cycling destinations in Tokyo. However, I hadn’t gotten enough time to explore the main attraction, the Wakasu Seaside Park. I decided I’ll properly explore that place today. I finished breakfast quickly, packed a power bank (because my old phone drains battery quickly while using maps), some snacks, and set out on my bike around 11:45 AM. 🚴🏼‍♂️

The Escape R3 SE is one of the best cross bikes out there, and I could feel it as I glided through the roads. My plan was to get lunch at a place on the way and then head to the park. I got some Veg Biryani from an Asian restaurant. Not the best I’ve had. Got some Chai and resumed.

On the way, suddenly the streets started looking very familiar. I figured I was close to the park and quit Google Maps. I tried taking some nice pictures of my bike and the roads.

Right then, I went to what I thought was the Wakasu Seaside Park (with full confidence 😎). I didn’t remember seeing a dock there, but I thought I might have missed that when I first went. The dock area was quite nice, families were having a picnic with a barbeque, and there was a museum too.

Later, I realized this was the Yumenoshima Park!

After a confusing few minutes and multiple attempts to find where I was, I finally decided to use Google Maps again. 😅

It took me another 30 minutes to get to the Wakasu Seaside Park. Once I got there, I realized why it is considered one of the best bicycling spots in the city. It has a great serene vibe with the blue ocean stretching wide along it, spacious roads for biking and running, and great greenery around to really make you feel connected with nature.

I noticed this really nice observation dock and spent some time on it.

This observation dock actually looks at the Tokyo Heliport. A lot of helicopters are parked there, and you can see many of them flying around too. I forgot to get pictures of it. 😕

Now, I was eager to cycle around this and started. While cycling around it, I realized how peaceful it is to come and experience nature like this once in a while. Work keeps me extremely busy during the weekdays, and on top of this, I need to cook, so I don’t really find time to relax much. Often on weekends, I keep searching for a refreshing plan, and sometimes I can’t find anything. This definitely was the best of the best. Just look at some of the pictures from there 😍… (had to compress them to below 5MB, so quality might be bad)

Now, let’s go to the main spot in this park. If you search it up online, these are places that are shown. I was surprised to see how pretty they look in real life.

While I was taking these pictures, I suddenly felt a strong wind. Knowing what can happen next, I turned to my cycle. To my horror, I saw it tipping on the stand. I sprinted (although it wasn’t very far) and just got there in time to grab the handle. Luckily, it didn’t hit the ground. ✌🏼 I would have been devastated if something bad happened to it so soon. 😅

I completed a full round of the perimeter and got back to this main place. I parked the bike and decided to spend some time there. I sat down, played some music, and just relaxed. I was feeling a lot of things at that point. I was grateful that I got to experience this. I was grateful for being in a city like Tokyo. I’m always reminded of my school days when I used to dream of buying gear cycles. 😂 It was a huge trend in school, but I genuinely was interested in such bicycles. I would research the latest models (not on the internet, but by seeing them in real life and talking to the owners) and make sketches of the ones I liked.

I also saw a few airplanes take off—I guess it was close to an airport. Airplanes, helicopters… wonder how many different types of aerial vehicles I could have seen in a day.

The wind was very strong, though. Even with three layers, gloves, and ear mufflers, I was feeling quite cold because of the wind. I decided to head back home. I felt very happy and satisfied that I explored this place. It was a slow and peaceful ride back home. It’s quite chill to ride a bike in Tokyo. The traffic is very disciplined, and the streets are clean. This trip was around 25 km in total.

I plan to visit many such biking spots around the city! It would be great if I can find some people who share the same passion! So, if you want to go somewhere, hit me up on my Instagram or satwik090202@gmail.com.

Till next time!

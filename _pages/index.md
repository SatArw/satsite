Hi there! Nice to meet you. 

I work as a Robotics Engineer at [Ugo Inc.](https://ugo.plus/) in Tokyo. I graduated with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) in July 2024. I am actively exploring the robotics field, state-of-the-art algorithms, and the challenges of applying them to real-world robots.

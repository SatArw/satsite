I'm researching about Robot Foundation models. Companies like Physical Intelligence and Skild AI are innovating so much in the robotics field so I'm actively following their story and drawing some inspiration. 

Nvidia Isaac Sim seems to be a great simulator for robotics but it's incredibly hard to set up and requires high specifications for the PC! Gazebo has great community support, many built-in packages and it's free! I'm not sure how well it can support AI model integration and Foundation model testing though. Webots is similar to Gazebo.

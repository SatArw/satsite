Nvidia Isaac Sim seems to be a great simulator for robotics but it's incredibly hard to set up and requires high specifications for the PC! Gazebo has great community support, many built-in packages and it's free! I'm not sure how well it can support AI model integration and Foundation model testing though. Webots is similar to Gazebo.

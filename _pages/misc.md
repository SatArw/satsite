I can't believe how well FC Barcelona is playing this season! They've beat Bayern Munich after nearly 5 years of losses and thrashed Real Madrid 4-0 and 5-2 in the two El Classico's that have happened till date. This will be a memorable season for sure. 

Life as a vegetarian is hard in Tokyo! I have to cook most my meals and there are limited options outside. My kitchen is very small. I'm trying my best though.
